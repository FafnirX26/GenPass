# GenPass
## Latest Update (1.3.7)
_Replaced quit() with sys.exit() for a better experience. Rewrote critical missing portions of the program after messy removal of "pyperclip" lib usage. Changed user menu for better experience._

## About
GenPass was originally written for a fun project with Python 3. Written on replit before moved to GitHub. 

## Next Update (1.4.0)
Hoping to add a credential saver, where you can save your credentials directly on your computer. It seems a little unsafe, so I'm working out how I'm going to do this.
