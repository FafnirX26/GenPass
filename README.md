# GenPass
## Latest Updates (1.3.0)
_Removed pyperclip library_
That wasn't really an update, but it does remove some unusable libraries

## About
GenPass was originally written for a fun project with Python 3. Written on replit before moved to GitHub. 

## Next Update (1.4.0)
Hoping to add a credential saver, where you can save your credentials directly on your computer. It seems a little unsafe, so I'm working out how I'm going to do this.
